By Henry Lowell, based on the accounts of a Nobel Prize–winning physicist from a major U.S. university

In a rare and candid exchange, Eyes Behind Light invites readers into a profound dialogue with a Nobel Prize–winning physicist who dares to speak about what science cannot quantify — consciousness, metaphysics, and the unseen layers of reality.

5) ECHOES BEFORE TIME --> 6.99$
By Henry Lowell, based on the accounts of a senior archaeologist from a major U.S. university

Did our civilization truly begin just five thousand years ago? Or are we merely the latest chapter in a far older, forgotten story? In Echoes Before Time, journalist Henry Lowell follows the trail of a reclusive archaeologist whose decades of research—through anomalous artifacts and megalithic ruins—reveal a cyclic history of mankind, where great civilizations have risen and vanished without a trace.

More than a record of strange relics, this book challenges the accepted timeline and questions the foundations of Darwinian theory. Echoes Before Time doesn’t aim to persuade—but to awaken.

6) ENTERING THE WORLD --> 9.99$
Avery Lin
As told by a Chinese monk devoted to a practice rooted in ancient Chinese principles of “Truthfulness, Compassion, and Forbearance”.

Entering The World is not just the story of a monk. It is the unfolding of a soul’s journey beyond stone temples and sacred scripts, into the raw, silent heart of truth.

From the misty mountains of rural China to the unseen prisons of belief and persecution, this book follows the extraordinary life of a man who walked away from form, ritual, and dogma — only to discover, in a most unexpected way, the path that transcends all forms.

Penned by journalist Avery Lin, this true account reveals a world many dare not speak of — where faith is tested not by trials, but by clarity; and where a “temple” may arise in the unlikeliest of places: a labor camp, a crowded train station, or the stillness of a suburban park in America.

7) THE LAST BELLS --> 9.99$
Written by Taylor Reed, based on ancient prophecies from East and West

For centuries, prophets from distant lands and ancient empires have spoken of a time when humanity would face a great reckoning—a collapse, a cleansing, and the dawn of a new age. Though scattered across history and culture, many of their visions point to the same pivotal moment: now.

In The Last Bells, journalist Taylor Reed brings together these echoes from East and West, revealing an uncanny convergence between forgotten scrolls, sacred scriptures, and modern-day revelations. This book is not merely a collection of prophecies—it is a warning, a reflection, and perhaps, a final call before the storm.

Told through the testimony of a spiritual cultivator whose third eye has been opened, Before Us explores more than alien presence—it delves into the hidden layers of human origin, the purpose of existence, and the silent echoes of civilizations that came before us.

9) THOUSAND LIVES --> 9.99$
Written by Casey Vale, based on the past-life stories of a young boy

What if a child could remember not just one past life, but many—spanning lost civilizations, ancient empires, and celestial realms beyond our world?

Based on his extraordinary visions and recollections, Thousand Lives invites readers on a journey across time and space, where the soul reawakens in different forms, cultures, and destinies. A tale that blurs the line between myth and memory—and dares us to ask: Who were we before we were born?
